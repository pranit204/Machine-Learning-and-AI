Summary of Analysis for the Toronto Police Crime Dataset
1. Data Cleaning
Column Selection:
Focused on relevant columns, such as OCC_YEAR, OCC_MONTH, OCC_DAY, OFFENCE, LAT_WGS84, and LONG_WGS84.
Missing Values:
Replaced missing values in OCC_YEAR, OCC_MONTH, and OCC_DAY with corresponding values from REPORT_YEAR, REPORT_MONTH, and REPORT_DAY.
Data Type Formatting:
Converted months from text (e.g., "January") to numeric format.
Ensured all date and time-related columns were properly formatted as integers.
Datetime Features:
Created REPORT_DATETIME and OCCURED_DATETIME columns to analyze temporal patterns.
Data Filtering:
Filtered data for OCC_YEAR >= 2014 to focus on recent crime trends.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Temporal Analysis:
Identified trends in crime counts by year and month.
Calculated the average and median delay (Days_Difference) between crime occurrence and reporting.
Neighborhood Insights:
Listed the top 20 neighborhoods (NEIGHBOURHOOD_158) with the highest crime counts.
Analyzed crime distribution across neighborhoods for specific offenses like Assault and B&E.
Offense Trends:
Created pivot tables to analyze crime frequencies and growth rates across years and months.
Highlighted seasonal trends by calculating the percentage of crimes by month for each offense type.
Correlation Analysis:
Investigated the relationship between OCC_HOUR (time of day) and the number of crimes.

3. Machine Learning Tasks
Task 1: Crime Hotspot Detection (Clustering)
Goal: Identify geographical crime hotspots.
Techniques Used:
Cleaned latitude and longitude data to remove invalid entries (e.g., 0 or out-of-range values).
Applied DBSCAN clustering to detect dense areas of crimes.
Visualized clusters to highlight hotspots.
Task 2: Predicting Crime Type (OFFENCE)
Goal: Predict the type of crime based on temporal, spatial, and categorical features.
Techniques Used:
Selected features like OCC_YEAR, OCC_HOUR, NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, and MCI_CATEGORY.
Encoded categorical features using OneHotEncoder and scaled numerical features.
Built a Logistic Regression model:
Achieved classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
Analyzed the confusion matrix to evaluate predictions.
Task 3: Temporal Crime Trends
Goal: Analyze crime trends over time.
Techniques Used:
Aggregated crime data by year and month to identify temporal trends.
Plotted yearly and monthly crime trends using line charts to highlight patterns.

4. Insights and Observations
Temporal Trends:
Seasonal variations were observed in crime counts, with some offenses peaking in specific months.
A noticeable delay was found between crime occurrence and reporting.
Hotspot Analysis:
Certain neighborhoods and geographical areas were identified as crime hotspots, allowing for targeted interventions.
Modeling:
The Logistic Regression model provided insights into predicting crime types, though performance may improve with additional features or advanced models.
