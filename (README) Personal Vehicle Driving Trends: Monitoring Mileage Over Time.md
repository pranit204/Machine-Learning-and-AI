**Project Overview**
I drive a lot, and I’ve created this project to analyze and predict the usage of my personal vehicle. Specifically, it focuses on odometer readings I’ve personally recorded either during scheduled maintenances or on other occasions.
The main purpose of this project is to track whether I am likely to exceed the 100,000 km mark before 2028, which could potentially void the vehicle's warranty. By monitoring this data, I aim to stay within the warranty limits while understanding my driving trends.

**Code Functionality**
Data Input:
The code begins with a dataset containing:
Dates: Dates when the odometer readings were recorded.
Total KMS Driven: Cumulative kilometers driven as of the given dates.

**Data Preparation:**
The dataset is organized into a structured format using a DataFrame.
Dates are converted to a proper datetime format for analysis and sorting.

**Analysis:**
The primary goal of the analysis is to:
Identify the latest recorded date.
Extract the total kilometers driven as of that date.

**Key Steps:**
The code processes the data to find the row with the most recent date using the idxmax() function.
From this row, the latest date and the corresponding odometer reading are extracted.
Output:

**The script outputs:**
The latest recorded date.
The total kilometers driven as of that date.

**Why This Matters**
With a high annual driving rate, I need to monitor my vehicle's usage closely.
This analysis helps me determine whether I might void the warranty limit of 100,000 km before 2028.
It also provides insights into driving trends, helps estimate future usage, and assists in planning for scheduled maintenance.

**How to Use**
Run the Code:
The code processes a predefined dataset of dates and odometer readings.
It identifies the most recent odometer reading for further analysis.
Modify for New Data:
Replace the dataset with your own vehicle data for personalized predictions.
