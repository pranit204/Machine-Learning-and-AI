Overview
Can you predict which people will get the H1N1 flu vaccine, using information about their backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors?
In this project, you will compete against each other in the annual “Machine Learning Competition,” a competition exclusively for MMAI 869 students. You will try to beat their fellow classmates to obtain glory, bragging rights, and, with a little bit of luck, some hard-earned knowledge. 
The main objectives of this project are for You to:
1.	Practice pushing ML models “to the limit” by exploring different techniques in cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection, data augmentation, ML algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, ensembles, and more.
2.	Learn the effect of building a model on one dataset and applying it to another.
3.	Practice splitting a complicated project amongst themselves in a tight timeline.

The Project
In this competition, we will look at vaccinations, a key public health measure used to fight infectious diseases. In particular, we will study the vaccine for the H1N1 flu virus, which first became available in 2009. We will build a model to predict whether an individual will get the H1N1 flu vaccine, based on some demographic and behavioral traits obtained on those individuals in a phone survey.
The Competition
You will be provided with a training dataset of 21,365 individuals. The features of the dataset include demongraphic information like age, sex, race, education level, income, occupation, and marital status, as well as behaviorual indicators, such as whether they wore masks, how ofthen they attended large gatherings, and how often they wash their hands. The dataset also indicates whether these inviduals did or did not receive the vaccine.
You will use the dataset to build a ML model that can predict whether an individual will receive the vaccine.
You will also be provided with a competition test dataset containing features of an additional 5,342 individuals. You will use their model to predict whether each of the 5,342 individuals will receive the vaccine. You will save the model’s predictions to a CSV file, and submit it to me. I will score their predictions (as I know the right answer) and will add the team’s score to the competition leaderboard.
